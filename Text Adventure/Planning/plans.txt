Desc: Text based adventure


Guacha is a thai gamer who needs to survive the heat of the tropical region by consuming one of his saving graces, shaved ice.
On one hot summer day, he could no longer take it. His left pinky finger nail was melting and it was only a matter of time until
his whole body would follow. He needed that shaved ice!

In an attempt to seize his beloved desert, there is only one problem. All the ice in the world is melting!
The evil Doctor Shamar is on the move to make the world a dilapidated sanctuary for anything frozen, let alone frozen treats!
Everyone always knew she hated ice! But nobody ever predicted that she'd go as far as removing all ice from the face of humanity
Join Guacha in an awe inspiring journey to gain possession of his cherished shaved ice before he meets the same fate as his coveted desert
